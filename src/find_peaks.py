# TODO: Note of where I am.
#
# I'm hoping the find_peaks function will turn up whether or not there
# are peaks seen from a given event -- and if not, maybe I can try
# adjusting the bandpass filter to do things right.
#
# To test that, I've saved (I think -- I may need to do this again)
# data in the two mseed files.  These are from this event:
#
# ./src/report.py main_plot --lat_e 17.0943 --lon_e -94.9609 --depth 108.369 --mag 5.9 --time_e 2023-10-07T05:06:55 --event_id 6000ldny --location '8 km W of Cuauht√©moc, Mexico' --bandpass_filter global
#
# What I'm trying to do is load the files, then play around with the
# find_peaks function to see what it finds.  At the moment, this is a
# big mix of hard-coded things, lines copy-pasta'd from report.py, and
#so on.
#
# The last bit I'm missing is the caculation of arrs (arrival times),
# which is only half-done by having the model there; I need to fill in
# data about the event as well.
#
# Honestly, I think this would be better in a Jupyter notebook -- this
# is exactly the kind of interactive exploration it excels at.
